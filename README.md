# Arduino Temperature, Humidity, Gyro, and RTC Sensor Project

This Arduino project is designed to read temperature and humidity data using a DHT11 sensor, gyroscopic data using an MPU-6050 sensor, and real-time clock data using a DS1307 RTC sensor. The collected data is then displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen.
